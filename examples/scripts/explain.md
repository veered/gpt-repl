{{ show_code(params.file) }}

Summarize the above code in the following format:

### 1. Purpose & Goals
This should describe the high-level purpose the author had for the code. It's less about the code and more about intention. It should put the purpose of the code in the context of the entire project, not just summarize the file in isolation.

### 2. Example Usage
Show an example of how a programmer or customer can make use of the code in this file. Focus on the most important parts. Start this section with "Here's an example"

### 3. Code Overview
Describe the most important parts of the implementation itself. Ignore unimportant or obvious details. Start this section with "The most important".

### 4. Type Signatures
Show class and function type signatures in a Markdown list, like `name(arg1 : type) -> type`.

Your response must be broken into these 4 sections.
